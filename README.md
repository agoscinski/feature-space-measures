Features (if precomputed in `/features` with computation script):
 - SOAP features are computed with librascal https://github.com/cosmo-epfl/librascal
 - BPSF were precomputed with RuNNer https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/560580.html generation input file code snippets are available in `/features/BPSF`
 - NICE features were precomputed with https://github.com/cosmo-epfl/nice
